In order to run the game you only need the Images zip and the Blood_Shooter.jar file. 
Extract the Images folder to the same location as the Blood_Shooter.jar file. 
The BloodShooter folder holds the code, but it is not needed for running the game

This project was done in collaboration with Real Programming 4 Kids class.
